<p>These are translation notes for the mini drama series "banana actually." I'm
using this series for korean listening practice. The language in it is pretty
natural, and spoken rapidly. Even though there are korean and english
subtitles, it's still pretty challenging for me to follow along and try to
understand all at the same time. So I made these translation notes as a
companion piece to the videos. The notes aim to point out and explain any
unusual vocab, grammar points, and ways of speaking that you might not
encounter in a text book. You can click the blue toggle-button below to hide
the annotations if you just want to read the transcript.

<p><small>Disclaimer: English translations have been modified from original
english subs, in most cases to make them sound more natural, but in other
cases, where I couldn't avoid it, I rearranged them to line up better alongside
the korean source text, even when that makes them a little more clunky
sounding. While I have had these notes checked by native and bilingual speakers
there may still be transcription errors or flat out mistakes. If you find any,
do let me know at (gianni at scaramanga dot co dot uk).

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>There is some background chatter in this video that is not part of the main
dialog. I've coloured these in a light blue to distinguish them.

상담 means like "relationship advice" or "dating advice."

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
At first it sounds like a very convoluted way to say this. But 생일이라면
would make it sound like the 다면/이라면 grammar point which is not the right
meaning, too conditional, without the meaning of "when..." And 생일이면 would
mean more like "when it's someone's birthday." So finally, 생일이라고 하면
means "when somebody says it is their birthday" - which here is slightly
shortened, or rephrased as 생일이라 그러면...

그러면서 has a very subtle meaning here, something along the lines of
"nevertheless" or "yet still." The closest korean equivalent would probably be
이런저런 얘길 나누는데 또 만날 때마다 싸워.

<p>The V + ㄹ/을 때마다 grammar point means "every time V." so "every time they
meet, they argue."

<tr>
<td>얘는 너한테 꾸준히 여자를 물어다주고</td>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
물어다주다 contains a pretty important grammar point that I couldn't find much
good information about on the internet. When the verb being done for someone
implies moving the object of the sentence or transferring it from one place to
another then one must use the V다 주다 form rather than V 주다 otherwise the
sentence sounds wrong.

<p>For example 엄마새가 아기새에게 먹이를 물어다 준다. The mother bird brings
(in her mouth) food for the baby bird. Here 다 준다 is needed because the 먹이
is being brought, moved, delivered, or is otherwise accompanying/accompanied by
the subject.

<p>But for 엄마가 아기에게 음식을 사 준다. Here just 주다 suffices because the
action of buying the food is happening in one place.

<p>But if mom then brings the food back for the baby, then it's 엄마가 아기에게
음식을 가져다 준다. Get it?

means "separately", or "in isolation." So really she's saying "Sometimes we
meet together separately, like this." I guess the two-or-three part is
reflecting what's shown on screen.

has a complex set of meanings but here it means "to acompany." Again the V다
주다 grammar point is being used. 

<p>As a quick note, often V다 주다 can be spelled V다가 주다 with little or no
change in meaning. But in this case it wouldn't be appropriate. The V다가 주다
form has a sort of nuance that the subject being transported does not have
agency, or it's will is not involved. I'm not sure it would give the meaning of
the friend being kidnapped or anything like that, but it'd certainly sound a
bit weird, like they're some sort of package to be delivererd.

<p>The last part is more literally, "You must be kidding? (he asked me)"
