<h2><span title="My korean studying journey">나의 한국어 공부 경험담</span></h2>
<p>I've been learning the korean language for almost 3 years now. I still
pretty much suck. I haven't studied it formally but just through interacting
with native speakers. Trying to shoot the shit with them over drinks, or chat
with taxi drivers and that kind of thing.

<p>I'm at the stage where I understand most of the basic grammar, and have a
reasonable vocabulary of possibly a thousand or so words that I can use and
maybe another 1 or 2 thousand I'm familiar with when I hear them. I tend to
pick up a few new words every week even if I'm not studying, just through
repeatedly hearing them. It's the same with new grammar points, I'll learn a
new one maybe once every few weeks. Just by hearing it and looking it up, and
they seem to stick pretty easily

<p>Nevertheless, I'm still pretty unsatisified with my progress. I have to
think a lot when I speak, composing most of the sentence in my head before
openening my mouth. Listening to new and exotic utterances is still supremely
difficult for me. For that reason, I find reading and writing, eg. over
text-messaging apps, much easier.

<p>Right now I'm trying to do repeated listening to improve my listening
comprehension, and hopefully that will improve my speaking too. I've found a
series of short (2-3mins per episode) <a
	href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4u2X5QolYdz4faUfKRm3_w">web
	dramas</a> which I enjoy listening to. But are quite challenging, as
they make no concessions for language learners. There are, however, korean and
english subtitles, which helps a lot.

<p>I am working on creating companion pieces to these dramas, with annotations explaining any unusual vocabulary, grammar points, usages thereof, or ways of speaking (from the perspective of an intermediate learner).

<p>If you find any errors in transcriptions, or annotations, or if you just
enjoy these and find them useful. Please do let me know at (gianni at
scaramanga dot co dot uk).
