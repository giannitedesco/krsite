<p>These are translation notes for the mini drama series "banana actually." I'm
using this series for korean listening practice. The language in it is pretty
natural, and spoken rapidly. Even though there are korean and english
subtitles, it's still pretty challenging for me to follow along and try to
understand all at the same time. So I made these translation notes as a
companion piece to the videos. The notes aim to point out and explain any
unusual vocab, grammar points, and ways of speaking that you might not
encounter in a text book. You can click the blue toggle-button below to hide
the annotations if you just want to read the transcript.

<p><small>Disclaimer: English translations have been modified from original
english subs, in most cases to make them sound more natural, but in other
cases, where I couldn't avoid it, I rearranged them to line up better alongside
the korean source text, even when that makes them a little more clunky
sounding. While I have had these notes checked by native and bilingual speakers
there may still be transcription errors or flat out mistakes. If you find any,
do let me know at (gianni at scaramanga dot co dot uk).

<tr>
<td>이렇게 앉아있으니까</td>
<td>A woman was sitting like this</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
Here 앉아 있다 means that "she had sat down", the 있다 emphasises the action
had continued - in other words she had remained seated. Also (으)니까 does not
seem to really mean "since" or "because" as it is usually translated in
english. In this context 으니까 is a neutral transition between this clause and
the next. It's connecting one event to the other in the natural flow of events
which are occuring to the subject, outside of her own will or intentionality.
In this context 있어서 would sound strange because the girlfriend is not the
subject of the action in the next clause.
</td>

<tr>
<td>남자가 발 끝에다 형광펜을 발라 주더라고</td>
<td>And her boyfriend painted her toenails with a highlighter pen</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
Here 에다 is short for 에다가 which emphasises the adding of something to a
location. In this case adding highlighter pen to her toenails.

means lame, amateurish, or sloppy as in "He's a sloppy worker." Both adverbs are describing the way he was painting her nails, crookedly and sloppily.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>그러면서 자기가 할 수 있는 최대한의 정성으로</td>
<td>But doing the best he could</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
Here 자기 is the recursive pronoun, like the "his" in "he did his best." It
refers back to "남자가" - the original subject at the start of the sentence.
The sentence seems to end without a verb -  left hanging on 으로... But this is
still grammatical since the predicate 발라 주더라고 which came before functions
as if it were the verb for the whole sentence. In my experience, korean
speakers seems to do this a lot: produce a full sentence ending with the verb,
but then add on some extra details afterwards.

<p><a
	href="http://endic.naver.com/search.nhn?sLn=en&isOnlyViewEE=N&query=%EC%B5%9C%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C">최대한</a>
is not a descriptive 하다 verb, but a chinese loanword 最大限 (to the limit).
<a
href="http://endic.naver.com/search.nhn?sLn=en&searchOption=all&query=%EC%A0%95%EC%84%B1">정성</a>
is from the chinese 精誠 (sincerity), so the phrase 최대한의 정성으로 하다 means "to do
something with the utmost sincerity". The English translation seems, to me, to rather downplay his efforts in comparison to the original text!
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>남자친구가 생기면 나도 저거 해보고 싶다</td>
<td>I want to try that when I have a boyfriend</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
I like this. Although the translation is very straight-forward, it gives me a
feeling more like "when a boyfriend arises/happens". It sounds, to me, less
individualistic or posessive than "when I get a boyfriend" or "when I have a
boyfriend". Slightly more fatalistic. But maybe that's just me?
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>뭐 그런 생각을 했었어</td>
<td>That was the thought that came to my mind.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
Here I had to change the english translation to make it match the order of the
original. The real meaning here is that "As I was watching the movie, I had
this thought. I want to try that when I have a boyfriend." The original
ordering sounds pretty clunky in English, but pretty natural in korean. Sorry
about that!

<tr>
<td>나란히 서서 양치를 하고</td>

<tr>
<td>봐서 가능하면 수염도 깎고</td>
<td>Shave his beard, if I can.</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
This is an interesting construction I hadn't heard before.
At first I thought 봐서 was functioning like the auxilliary verb
아/어 보다 - to try something. But I think the meaning is more like
"I'll see." So 봐서 가능하면 would be "I'll see if it's possible to (do sth)"
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>다시 이불 속으로 들어가서</td>
<td>Then get back in to bed</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>하루 종일 누워있고</td>
<td>Lie there all day</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
The speaker denasalizes the ㄴ in 누워 which makes it sound like a ㄷ. Korean
phonology is hard. We just have to suck it up.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>그러다 배고프면 같이 요리도 해먹고</td>
<td>Cook together when we are hungry</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
Again, 그러다 seems to be short for 그러다가. 요리해먹다 is another compound
verb you might not find in a dictionary for "to cook and eat."
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>그렇게 먹고 또 나가서</td>
<td>And then after eating, go out</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>맛있는거 사먹고</td>
<td>To get something delicious</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
Interestingly, 사먹다 is not in the dictionary, but it just means buy something
to eat (or drink, since 먹다 can be more broadly interpreted as "to consume").
In this context, it seems like she means something more like a coffee, or maybe
an ice-cream, since they've already cooked and eaten a meal together.

</tr>

<tr>
<td>여기저기 골목길을 구경하고</td>
<td>Wander around alleyways</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
구경 usually translates as sightseeing. Not sure what sights there are to see
in alleyways. But really this word can be used for any sort of looking around.

<tr>
<td>그냥 누워있으면서 야경도 보고</td>
<td>Enjoy the view, just lying there</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
A nuance is lost in the english subs. The word 야경 (from 夜景) means night
view. This is the same 야 as in 야식 (夜食) or "late night snack." I guess it
means they're lying there looking at the night sky or the city lights. I don't
recall ever having seen a single star in the sky over Seoul.

<td>나도 꼭 와보고 싶었어</td>
<td>I wanted to come here.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>어둡고, 비좁고</td>
<td>It's dark, cramped</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>복잡한 전선들이 널려있고</td>
<td>There are tangled wires everywhere</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
It sounds to me like the speaker is actually saying 널려있지.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>실제로는 처음보는 악기들과</td>
<td>Instruments I haven't seen before</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>컴퓨터의 요상한 화면들과</td>
<td>Strange pictures on the computer screen</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
The korean dictionary (as opposed to korean-english) lists 요상하다 as being a
mistaken form of 이상하다 &ndash; "이상하다’의 잘못." 요상하다 can also have a
more supernatural feeling to it, but I don't think that's the intention in this
context.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>네가 마시다가 남은 커피</td>
<td>Left-over coffee</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
The english translation is slightly ambiguous. She's describing unfinished,
cold cups of coffee lying around, or something of that nature. We can tell this
because the ~다가 in 마시다가 implies that the act of drinking was interrupted
or unfinished and 남다 means "to remain" or "to be left over."
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>벗어둔 시계</td>
<td>Your watch that you took off</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
<a
	href="http://endic.naver.com/search.nhn?sLn=en&isOnlyViewEE=N&query=%EB%B2%97%EB%8B%A4">벗다</a>
means to take something off, like an item of clothing, or maybe even to shrug
off a heavy load. The 아/어 두다/놓다 grammar point means that an action is
done in advance, for convenience, or to be ready for something. While 놓다
might seem to make more sense in english (for put down somwhere), 두다 here (to
put in place, or set in place) seems to be emphasizing the place where he keeps
his watch, when he's removed it for comfort.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>손가락을 따라 움직이는 건반들과</td>
<td>Keys that move under your fingers</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>네가 어떤 시간들을 보내는지 궁금했어</td>
<td>I wanted to know how you spend your time</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
시간들을 보내다 isn't about "sending time" but how one passes the time. It's a sort of idiomatic usage of 보내다, like "날을 보내다" or "to spend the day."
</td>

<td>이런 얘기 끝없이 밤새도록 해보래도 할 수 있을 거 같은데</td>

phonology is hard. Let's go shopping!
