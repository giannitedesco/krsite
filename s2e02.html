<p>These are translation notes for the mini drama series "banana actually." I'm
using this series for korean listening practice. The language in it is pretty
natural, and spoken rapidly. Even though there are korean and english
subtitles, it's still pretty challenging for me to follow along and try to
understand all at the same time. So I made these translation notes as a
companion piece to the videos. The notes aim to point out and explain any
unusual vocab, grammar points, and ways of speaking that you might not
encounter in a text book. You can click the blue toggle-button below to hide
the annotations if you just want to read the transcript.

<p><small>Disclaimer: English translations have been modified from original
english subs, in most cases to make them sound more natural, but in other
cases, where I couldn't avoid it, I rearranged them to line up better alongside
the korean source text, even when that makes them a little more clunky
sounding. While I have had these notes checked by native and bilingual speakers
there may still be transcription errors or flat out mistakes. If you find any,
do let me know at (gianni at scaramanga dot co dot uk).

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>There is a lot of background chatter in this video that is not part of the
main dialog. I've coloured these in a light blue to distinguish them.

<td colspan=2>
The difference in meaning between 궁금했어 and 궁금해 했어 is apparently so
subtle that nobody can really explain it nor would they translate them
differently. The closest I can think is the difference between "you were
curious" and "you felt curious."

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
The 뭐 at the start of the sentence like this is sort of a filler, it might
translate here as "well, ..." &ndash; it's contrasting with the 그냥 in the
last sentence. "It's <em>just</em> a studio." But now he's saying, "well, it's
<em>also</em> a place for our hobbies and those sorts of things."

<p>취미 indeed means hobby or pastime. And 생활 (生活) means something like
life or lifestyle. For example 개인 생활 means personal-life, or 결혼 생활
means married-life. So here 취미 생활 means "the aspect of life related to
my/our hobbies." I don't think we have a really good word or idiom for this in
english.

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
In this case, the 뭐 would mean something more like "anyway" rather than "well"
as the earlier instance would translate.

<p>This is not the ~는 사이 grammar point, it just means 사이 as in relationship.
"We have a relationship where we pay the rent together." 내다 here means to
pay, or to contribute.

<p>The english translation of "just" could be ambiguous. The 만 that could
translate as "just" is attached to 월세 so the meaning is that the rent is
something they share, but (presumably) everything else in there is
indindividually (or by some other arrangement) paid for or owned. A more direct
translation would be "we just pay just the rent together" but that sounds silly
in english.

<td>그러니까 나는 한달에 십사만 삼천 오백원만 내면</td>
<td>Which means if I pay 143,500 won every month</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
I would probably have translated "which means" as "so". I think 그러니까 is
used instead of 그래서 because a pre-existing state of affairs is being
described in which the speaker hadn't set up the cause and effect &ndash; "Rent
is X, so my share is Y." Rather he is passively describing connected states of
affairs.

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
Ah, east-asian culture. Shoes are generally taken off in houses, in some
workplaces, and in some restaurants. But not everywhere. The speaker is unsure
of the etiquette in the studio and so she asks.
</td>
</tr>

<tr class=chatter>
<td>벗으면 좋지</td>
<td>That would be great</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
As a cultural note. It seems like they treat the place as a (second) home, so
they take their shoes off here.

<tr>
<td>넌 신기해 했어</td>
<td>You seemed amazed</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
The form <em>adj</em> + 하다 means "to feel that something is <em>adj</em>." So
here it means "you felt that (sth) was amazing." Note that although this is the
same auxilliary verb form as the earlier "궁금해 했어" the change it makes to
the meaning is slightly different. Some of the adjectives being modified are
slightly ambiguous (to us english speakers) as to whether they are active or
passive (bored vs boring, scared vs scary)

</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
A nuance is lost in the english translation. 바라보다 is more like to gaze at
(sth) or to look expectantly (at sth). It's a compund verb of 바라다 (to hope)
and 보다 (to look).

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
The correct past tense conjugation of 바라다 (to hope, or to wish) is 바랐어
but people just say 바랬어 even though it's wrong. It's just one of those
things. It's like how people say 같애 instead of 같아, tht ending 아 can become
애. I read someone saying that this is part of an ongoing vowel shift in the
korean language, but who knows...
</td>

<tr>
<td>아닌 것 같기도 했고</td>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
아닌 것 같기도 하다 is a weaker, more unsure, form of 아닌 것 같다.
</td>

<tr>

<td>Or maybe you didn’t know that...</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
Here is where agglutinative languages get interesting. This can be expanded to:
아니라고 하기보다는 모르는 것 같은게.  The first part is doubting the
previous assessment that she didn't "want it like he did." So 아니라고 하기보다
translates to "Rather than (you) not (wanting it)." The 는 particle here seems
to be downplaying or indicating the speakers uncertainty about this clause. The
last part is straight-forward, it's basically saying 모르는 것 같다 &ndash; "I
think/guess that you don't know." Finally, the 게 ending would translate to
"about" or "that" as in "she doesn't know about/that ..."
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>좋아하면 당연히 만지고 싶어지잖아</td>
<td>when you like someone, you come to want to touch them</td>
</tr>

<tr class="collapse">
<td colspan=2>
Well this is what he thinks that she doesn't know about. The speaker supposes
not that she didn't want it, but that she was confused and surprised by her own
feelings. The pacing of events in the video seems to back up this
interpretation, but the text is a little bit ambiguous in both languages.

<p>Bonus points for using the title in the dialog. Actor turns to look straight
in to the camera. Say cheese!
