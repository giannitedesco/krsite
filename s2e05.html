<p>These are translation notes for the mini drama series "banana actually." I'm
using this series for korean listening practice. The language in it is pretty
natural, and spoken rapidly. Even though there are korean and english
subtitles, it's still pretty challenging for me to follow along and try to
understand all at the same time. So I made these translation notes as a
companion piece to the videos. The notes aim to point out and explain any
unusual vocab, grammar points, and ways of speaking that you might not
encounter in a text book. You can click the blue toggle-button below to hide
the annotations if you just want to read the transcript.

<p><small>Disclaimer: English translations have been modified from original
english subs, in most cases to make them sound more natural, but in other
cases, where I couldn't avoid it, I rearranged them to line up better alongside
the korean source text, even when that makes them a little more clunky
sounding. While I have had these notes checked by native and bilingual speakers
there may still be transcription errors or flat out mistakes. If you find any,
do let me know at (gianni at scaramanga dot co dot uk).

    Although I couldn't find a good resource about it online, I was told the pattern V긴 V냐 means the speaker is suspicious about V. For example, <em>믿긴 믿냐?</em> would mean <em>Do you really believe that?</em>. Then the 대 comes from 다고 making it reported speech (interestingly embedded inside the first pattern), rendering something like "Did he really say (or think?) he likes you?"
